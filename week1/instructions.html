  <h3> Setting up the environment: </h3>
  <ol>
    <h4> The UNIX shell </h4>
    <li>
      First you need to become familiar with the very basics of operating a unix shell.
      Its the basis for many things we will be doing. On your mac use <code> cmnd + spacebar </code> and
      type in <code>terminal</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Follow along with this resource <a href="https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/superap/unixcmd.html" target="blank">
      https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/superap/unixcmd.html </a> and become familiar with the basics of intercating with your computer
      via the command line - specifcally creating files and navigating through directories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a directory called <code>projects</code> somewhere near the root of your User directory.
      This is where you will keep all of your projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a directory for your first assignment (which you will be posting to github).
    </li>
    <li>
      Within this directory create two files. index.html and styles.css <code> touch index.html styles.css </code>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h4> The text editor: </h4>
    <li>
      To write code you will want a text editor. Download atom <a href="https://atom.io/" target="blank"> https://atom.io/ </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Open the folder you created from the first task in atom and begin hacking! If open index.html (the file you created above)
      in chrome you will be able to see the progress you are making. If you look above (in this html file) take note
      that the <code> link </code> tag points to <code> styles.css </code> Thats how I am adding margin and this
      Helvetica font family to the html.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <h4> The assignment: </h4>
    <div>
      Using HTML and CSS alone (the image file is included) you are going to reproduce this mock up. Its important to note
      that as developers there are many tools we can use to speed up our work flow. One amazing tool that you are
      going to want to use heavily during this assignment (and most web development) is Chrome dev tools. To open, simply
      press <code> cmnd + option + j </code> in chrome. Shifiting over to the elements page will allow you to edit the css
      of any website in real time (including this one). <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" target="blank"> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools </a>
    </div>
    <img id="mock-up" src="./images/mock_up.jpg"/>
    <li> The resources for these icons can be found in <code> /images </code> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://hipsum.co/"> https://hipsum.co/ </a> is a great resource for placeholder content </li>
    <li> Ultimately the goal is to have these cards flip in place (something similar to this) <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-flip.php" target="blank">
      https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-flip.php</a> They can be stacked in a column or a row however you prefer.</li>
    <div>
      When you are finished you will create a github repo and upload your project. This will be the start
      of your awesome portfolio.
    </div>
  </ul>
